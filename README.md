Karl is a small robot living inside a tube television. With the help of a library called [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama), he can access artificial intelligences. Primarily, [Llava](https://ollama.ai/library/llava) and [Llama2](https://ollama.ai/library/llama2) are used, which operate in both image and text-based contexts. Users can have documents processed, get image descriptions, and analyze current websites through Karl. Llama2 has a large database that can be accessed through Karl.
